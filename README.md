# Tac-Tic-Toe
Is a game that is a little evolved form of the simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game features two types of mode each with 3 levels of difficulty. The two game modes are as follows:
  1) 3 in a Row:
    In this game mode at one time the number of O's or X's cannot exceed 3. So once the player/computer has 3 marks on the board, in their next turn the earliest mark gets removed and they get a chance to change its position.
  2) Where are the edges?
    In this game mode, you dont start with any board. The objective of the game is same, however it involved adding edges and marks as the turns proceed. So every turn the computer/player gets a chance to add an edge and a marker until the board is completed in which they only get to put a mark on the newly constructed board. This game mode provides a lot of flexibility to the player/computer by changing the outcome of the game by changing the relative positions of marks in the board because of addition of edges.
